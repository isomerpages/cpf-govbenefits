#### CDC Vouchers
<b>1. Why is the Government giving out these vouchers?</b>
<br><br>As part of the Assurance Package for GST, all Singaporean households will receive two tranches of CDC Vouchers worth $200 each in 2023 and 2024 to further cushion the impact of the GST rate increase for all Singaporeans. All Singaporean households will receive an additional $100 CDC Vouchers in 2023 from the $1.5 billion support package announced in Oct 2022.
<br><br>
<b>2. Where can I spend my CDC Vouchers at?</b>
<br><br>The CDC Vouchers can be spent at participating heartland merchants and hawkers, and supermarkets. More details will be announced by CDCs subsequently.<br><br>

<br><br>All Singaporean households are automatically eligible for the scheme, and will receive a notification letter on how to claim their CDC Vouchers. Each Singaporean household is eligible for one set of vouchers.
<br><br>
<b>4. What will I/my household need to claim the CDC Vouchers?</b>
<br><br>You will require a valid Singpass account and smartphone to log in and claim the vouchers.
