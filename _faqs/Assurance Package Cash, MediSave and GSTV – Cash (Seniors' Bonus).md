				  <li class="Numbering" style="font-size:17px"><details><summary><b>How do I receive my cash benefit via GovCash?</b></summary><br>You can transfer your benefits to your PayNow-NRIC-linked bank account or make payments to merchants by scanning their PayNow or NETS QR code using the LifeSG app.<br><br> The LifeSG app can be downloaded from the Apple App store or Google Play Store. <br><Br>Alternatively, you can withdraw your cash payout at OCBC ATMs islandwide. You just need to enter:<br><br>
						a) Your unique 8-digit Payment Reference Number (PRN)<br>
						b) Your NRIC number; and<br>
						c)	pass the facial verification<br><br>
You do not need to have an OCBC bank account to use this service. <br><br>
						You will receive the PRN via a letter and your Singpass app (if any) or SMS after AP Cash has been paid. You can also log into the <a href="https://www.govpayouts.gov.sg/cds/ap/login" class="hyperlink">e-services</a> with your Singpass to view your PRN by selecting “GovCash PRN” that is found at the menu on the left.

						This security feature prevents any fraudulent withdrawal of the Government benefit by third party using photographs or videos belonging to the beneficiary and ensuring only the eligible Singaporean can perform the withdrawal of his or her Government benefit.

### Other Enquiries
<b>1. Do I qualify for the AP Cash and/or GSTV – Cash (Seniors’ Bonus) if my Assessable Income is unavailable, but I meet all other criteria? </b><br><br>If your AI is unavailable because you have not yet filed your income tax returns, please call IRAS at 1800 356 8300. Once your AI for YA2022 has been finalised by IRAS, we will notify you if you are eligible for the AP Cash in 2022 and 2023 GSTV – Cash (Seniors’ Bonus).<br><br>
<b>2. One of the eligibility criteria for the 2023 GSTV – Cash (Seniors' Bonus) is that the Income Earned in 2021 (AI for the YA2022) must not exceed $34,000. Why is the AI for YA2022 (instead of YA2023) used?</b><br><br>For Singaporeans to receive their 2023 GSTV – Cash (Seniors' Bonus) by February 2023, we assess the eligibility based on Income Earned for 2021 (AI for YA2022) which is the latest tax assessment available. <br><br>
<b>3. Why is AV used instead of flat type for GSTV – Cash (Seniors’ Bonus)?</b><br><br>AV is currently used as a proxy for wealth and family support. While it is not a perfect measure, it is currently the best available proxy to assess the financial resources available to the individual, including from immediate family members that reside with this individual.<br><br>
<b>4. Why is AV used for GSTV – Cash (Seniors’ Bonus) but not for AP Cash?</b><br><br>Our social support schemes are generally means-tested to ensure support is targeted to help Singaporeans with greater needs. For GSTV – Cash (Seniors’ Bonus), the approach of using both AV and AI is to enable us to better target the support to those who are in need of greater help.<br><br>For AP Cash, the benefits are meant for all adult Singaporeans to cushion the impact of the GST increase. Lower-income Singaporeans and those who do not own more than one property will receive higher cash benefits.<br><br>
<b>5. Do I qualify for the GSTV – Cash (Seniors' Bonus) if the AV of my residence is unavailable, but I meet all other criteria?</b><br><br>The AV is based on IRAS’ property tax assessment. If you have not received your property tax notification for 2022, the AV of your residence may not have been available at the point of determining the allotment for the 2023 GSTV – Cash (Seniors' Bonus).<br><br>You may contact us at 1800 2222 888 or log in to the <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.govpayouts.gov.sg/cds/gstv/login"> e-services </a> with your Singpass to update us when the AV of your residence is available.<br><br>
<b>6. How much will I get if I stay in a rented property?</b><br><br>The amount of GSTV – Cash (Seniors' Bonus) you get depends on the AV of your place of residence as stated on your NRIC as at 31 July 2022, regardless of whether you own or rent the property.<br><br>There is no AV criteria for AP Cash.<br><br>
<b>7. If I own several properties, which AV will be used?</b><br><br>Those who own more than one property will be eligible for AP Cash but not the GSTV – Cash (Seniors’ Bonus).  Such properties may include shophouses, private residential properties or non-residential properties such as commercial or industrial properties.<br><br>
<b>8. I am residing residing overseas, am I eligible to receive the AP Cash, MediSave and/or GSTV – Cash (Seniors' Bonus)?</b><br><br>The AP benefits and/or GSTV – Cash (Seniors' Bonus) are meant to provide relief to Singaporeans to address their concerns on the cost-of-living in Singapore and to cushion the impact of the planned GST rate increase for Singaporeans residing in Singapore. Therefore, you are not eligible for these benefits if you are residing overseas.<br><br><b>9. If the beneficiary passes away before the payment of the AP Cash and/or GSTV – Cash (Seniors’ Bonus) is made , will he/she still qualify?</b><br><br>No. The AP Cash and/or GSTV – Cash (Seniors' Bonus) is only paid out to Singapore citizens who are alive.<br><br>
