# How can I tell if the AP SMS I received is authentic?
With the recent rise in scam and phishing attempts, it is important to verify that the message received is genuinely sent by an official source.<br><br>
	<img src="/images/SMS1.jpg" style="width: 30%; height: 30%;"><br>*This is only an example of an Assurance Package (AP) SMS. The actual SMS received may be different.<br><br>Here are some tips on how you can protect yourself against phishing SMSes purporting to be sent from AP:<br>
<ul>
<li style="font-size:20px">Check that the SMS is sent by “MOF” to the mobile number registered with Singpass. If you are unsure of whether you had registered your mobile number, you may check your profile using your Singpass app or the <a href="https://www.singpass.gov.sg/" class="hyperlink">Singpass website</a>. </li>
	<li style="font-size:20px">Verify that the last four characters of the masked NRIC number are the same as your NRIC number.</li>
	<li style="font-size:20px">If the SMS contains an URL, make sure that the domain of the URL ends with a “.gov.sg” before clicking on it.</li></ul>
We will never ask you to reply to the AP SMS nor direct you to a non-Government website. Do report any suspicious SMS spoofing to  <a href="/contact-us-ap/" class="hyperlink">us</a>. <br><br>
You are encouraged to download the Singpass App from official app stores (e.g. App Store, Play Store or Huawei AppGallery; check that the app is developed by “Government Technology Agency”) so that you can receive secured messages on your eligibility for GSTV and other Government schemes. <br><br>
Be cautious, pay attention to scams and don’t be the next victim of fraud.
