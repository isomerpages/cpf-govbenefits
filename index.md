  At Budget 2020, the Government announced a $6 billion Assurance Package (AP)
  for GST to cushion the impact of the planned GST increase for all
  Singaporeans. The AP was enhanced to $6.6 billion at Budget 2022.


  The AP comprises cash payouts for all adult Singaporeans, additional cash for lower-income seniors, additional GST Voucher – U-Save, MediSave top-ups for children and seniors, and Community Development Council (CDC) Vouchers for Singaporean households. In addition, the Government will provide a top up to the Citizens’ Consultative Committee (CCC) ComCare Fund and grants to self-help groups.
