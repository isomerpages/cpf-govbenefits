### Community Development Council (CDC) Vouchers ###

The Government will partner the CDCs to distribute two rounds of vouchers to all Singaporean households, in 2023 and 2024 (see Table 1). Each round of vouchers will be worth $200 (i.e. $400 in total), and these vouchers can be used at participating heartland shops and hawker centres, as well as major supermarkets. <br><br>
