### Community Development Council (CDC) Vouchers ###

The Government will partner the CDCs to distribute two rounds of vouchers under the Assurance Package to all Singaporean households, in 2023 and 2024. Each round of vouchers will be worth $200 (i.e. $400 in total), and these vouchers can be used at heartland shops and supermarkets. <br><br>

 *As part of the $1.5 billion support package announced in Oct 2022 to provide further cost of living relief, every Singaporean household will receive additional $100 CDC Vouchers in 2023. This amounts to a total of $300 in 2023. 

 The CDCs will provide more details on the vouchers subsequently.
