# Overview 
At Budget 2020, the Government announced a $6 billion Assurance Package (AP) for GST to cushion the impact of the planned GST increase for all Singaporeans. The AP was enhanced to $6.6 billion at Budget 2022. 

Under the enhanced AP, the majority of Singaporean households will receive offsets to cover at least five years’ worth of additional GST expenses. Lower-income households will receive offsets covering about ten years’ worth of additional GST expenses.

The AP comprises cash payouts for all adult Singaporeans, additional cash for lower-income seniors, additional GST Voucher – U-Save, MediSave top-ups for children and seniors, and Community Development Council (CDC) Vouchers for Singaporean households. In addition, the Government will provide a top up to the Citizens’ Consultative Committee (CCC) ComCare Fund and grants to self-help groups.
