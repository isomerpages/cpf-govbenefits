# Overview 
At Budget 2020, the Government announced a $6 billion Assurance Package (AP) for GST to cushion the impact of the planned GST increase for all Singaporeans. The AP was enhanced to $6.6 billion at Budget 2022. 

Under the enhanced AP, the majority of Singaporean households will receive offsets to cover at least five years’ worth of additional GST expenses. Lower-income households will receive offsets covering about ten years’ worth of additional GST expenses.

The AP comprises cash payouts for all adult Singaporeans, additional cash for lower-income seniors, additional GST Voucher – U-Save, MediSave top-ups for children and seniors, and Community Development Council (CDC) Vouchers for Singaporean households. In addition, the Government will provide a top up to the Citizens’ Consultative Committee (CCC) ComCare Fund and grants to self-help groups.

To account for higher-than-expected inflation, the Government is reviewing the size and components of the AP. More details will be provided at Budget 2023. 

The Assurance Package is on top of the permanent GST Voucher (GSTV) scheme introduced by the Government in Budget 2012 to help lower- and middle-income Singaporean households defray their GST expenses, i.e. what they pay in GST.
