On 14 October 2022, DPM and Minister for Finance announced a $1.5 billion support package to provide further cost-of-living relief for all Singaporean households, with more support for lower- to middle-income groups. This includes a one-off Cost of Living (COL) Special Payment of up to $500 for 2.5 million adult Singaporeans. The COL Special Payment will be disbursed in December 2022, together with AP Cash payouts.

You are eligible for the COL Special Payment, if:

* You are a Singaporean aged 21 years old or above in 2023;

* Your Assessable Income (AI) for Year of Assessment (YA) 2022 is $100,000 or below; and

* You do not own more than one property.
