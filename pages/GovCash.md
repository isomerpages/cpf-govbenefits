		<summary><b>What is GovCash?</b></summary><br>GovCash is a payment mode that allows Singapore citizens to receive their payouts from Government agencies more quickly and conveniently. Singaporeans can withdraw their Government payouts in cash from over 500 OCBC ATMS located across Singapore. <br><br>
Previously, cheque recipients would have to deposit the cheques or encash them over the bank counters. GovCash allows them to receive their payouts at the OCBC ATM immediately at any time of the day. They are no longer restricted by the bank's operating hours. Singaporeans who prefer to seek assistance with their GovCash withdrawals can visit the ATMs located within OCBC's branches during operating hours, where OCBC Digital Ambassadors will be present to guide them. In addition, GovCash also allows recipients to use the scan-and-pay function and PayNow transfer option through the LifeSG mobile app.<br><br>

</details></li>
<li class="Numbering" style="font-size:17px"><details><summary><b>Is GovCash safe?</b></summary><br>GovCash is as secure as receiving payouts via cheque. It adopts the Singpass facial verification technology to authenticate users, including a liveness-detection capability that blocks the use of photographs, videos or masks during the verification process. Users are also required to key in their unique 8-digit Payment Reference Number (PRN) during the withdrawal of the Government payout at the OCBC ATMs. <br><br></details></li>

				  <li class="Numbering" style="font-size:17px"><details><summary><b>How do I receive my cash payout via GovCash?</b></summary><br>You can withdraw your cash payout at OCBC ATMs islandwide. You just need to enter:<br><br>
						a) Your unique 8-digit Payment Reference Number (PRN)<br>
						b) Your NRIC number; and<br>
						c)	passing the facial verification<br><br>
You do not need to have an OCBC bank account to use this service. <br><br>
						You will receive the PRN via a letter and your Singpass app (if any) or SMS after AP cash payouts has been made. You can also log into the <a href="https://www.govpayouts.gov.sg/cds/ap/login" class="hyperlink">e-services</a> with your Singpass to view your PRN by selecting “GovCash PRN” that is found at the menu on the left. This will only be available after the payment has been made.<br><br>
						You can also transfer your payouts to your PayNow-NRIC-linked bank account or make payments to merchants by scanning their PayNow or NETS QR code using the LifeSG app. The LifeSG app can be downloaded from the Apple App store or Google Play Store. <br><br>

</details></li>
				  <li class="Numbering" style="font-size:17px"><details><summary><b>I lost my letter containing the Payment Reference Number, can someone else take my money?</b></summary><br>It is not possible to withdraw the money with just the Payment Reference Number as GovCash uses the Singpass facial verification technology to authenticate users during the withdrawal of the Government payout from OCBC ATMs. The facial verification technology incorporates a liveness-detection capability that blocks the use of photographs, videos or masks during the verification process. <br><br>
						This security feature prevents any fraudulent withdrawal of the Government payout by third party using photographs or videos belonging to the beneficiary and ensuring only the eligible Singaporean can perform the withdrawal of his or her Government payout.

<b>Option 1: Use LifeSG to transfer to PayNow-NRIC linked bank account</b><br>
If the beneficiary has an existing bank account, he can link his account for PayNow-NRIC with his bank. Thereafter, login to LifeSG mobile app (LifeSG) using his Singpass to transfer his GovCash to his PayNow-NRIC linked bank account. The beneficiary will be able to receive his future Government payouts more quickly into his PayNow-linked bank account.<br><br>

<b>Option 2: Use LifeSG  for Scan & Pay</b><br>
The beneficiary can use LifeSG to scan participating merchant’s QR code for purchases or scan his friend/family’s QR code to transfer his GovCash to them.<br><br>

<b>Option 3: Appoint a proxy to perform ATM withdrawal on his behalf</b><br>
The beneficiary can appoint a proxy or if he is no longer able to appoint a proxy due to his medical condition, his official representative can act as his proxy to perform the ATM withdrawal on his/her behalf. To do so, the following conditions must be met:<br><br>

However, if the condition is known to be permanent (e.g. bedridden, immobile, physically incapacitated, disabled, intellectually disabled, autism, down syndrome, cerebral palsy, etc), the medical          documentation can be dated any time, and be used for future transactions.<br><br>
