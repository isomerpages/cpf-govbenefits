		<summary><b>What is GovCash?</b></summary><br>GovCash is a new payment mode that allows Singapore citizens to receive their payouts from Government agencies more quickly and conveniently. Singaporeans can withdraw their Government payouts in cash from over 500 OCBC ATMS located across Singapore. <br><br>
Previously, cheque recipients would have to deposit the cheques or encash them over the bank counters. GovCash allows them to receive their payouts at the OCBC ATM immediately at any time of the day. They are no longer restricted by the bank's operating hours. Singaporeans who prefer to seek assistance with their GovCash withdrawals can visit the ATMs located within OCBC's branches during operating hours, where OCBC Digital Ambassadors will be present to guide them. In addition, GovCash also allows recipients to use the scan-and-pay function and PayNow transfer option through the LifeSG mobile app.<br><br>

<li class="Numbering" style="font-size:17px"><details><summary><b>Is GovCash safe?</b></summary><br>GovCash is as secure as receiving payouts via cheque. It adopts the Singpass facial verification technology to authenticate users, including a liveness-detection capability that blocks the use of photographs, videos or masks during the verification process. Users are also required to key in their unique 8-digit Payment Reference Number (PRN) during the withdrawal of the Government payout at the OCBC ATMs. <br></details></li>

				  <li class="Numbering" style="font-size:17px"><details><summary><b>I lost my letter containing the Payment Reference Number, can someone else take my money?</b></summary><br>It is not possible to withdraw the money with just the Payment Reference Number as GovCash uses the Singpass facial verification technology to authenticate users during the withdrawal of the Government payout from OCBC ATMs. The facial verification technology incorporates a liveness-detection capability that blocks the use of photographs, videos or masks during the verification process. <br><br>
						This security feature prevents any fraudulent withdrawal of the Government payout by third party using photographs or videos belonging to the beneficiary and ensuring only the eligible Singaporean can perform the withdrawal of his or her Government payout.
