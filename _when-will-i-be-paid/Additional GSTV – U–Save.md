### Additional GSTV – U-Save ###
No sign-up is required to receive the additional GST Voucher (GSTV) – U-Save. The additional U-Save rebates will be credited together with the regular U-Save rebates directly into your household’s utility account managed by SP Services. <br><br>
Eligible households will be notified through quarterly inserts sent together with their utility bills and receive their quarterly GSTV – U-Save rebates automatically in April, July, October, as well as January. <br><br>
The GSTV – U-Save cannot be encashed because it is only meant to directly offset your household’s utility expenses. Any unused U-Save rebates will be rolled over to help offset your household’s utility bills for the following months.
