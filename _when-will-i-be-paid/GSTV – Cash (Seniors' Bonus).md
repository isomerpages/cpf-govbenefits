### GSTV – Cash (Seniors’ Bonus)


If you are eligible for the GSTV – Cash (Seniors’ Bonus), you will receive the payments in February each year, from 2023 to 2025.   <br><br>
Starting from 2022, we will no longer be issuing cheques. You are encouraged to link your NRIC to PayNow to receive your payouts earlier. If you do not have a PayNow-NRIC-linked bank account but have provided your bank account number to the Government previously, you will receive your payouts via bank transfer. If you do not have a bank account, the payouts will be credited to you via <a href="https://www.govpayouts.gov.sg/cds/gstv/login" class="hyperlink">GovCash.</a>
